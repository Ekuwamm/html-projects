    <h3>What is Body Mass Index?</h3>
    <p>
    The definition of body mass index (BMI) is the measurement of a person’s weight in relation to their height. Based on this measurement, a person’s weight will be categorised as either underweight, within the healthy BMI range, overweight, or obese, as defined by the World Health Organization (WHO).
    In 1985 the National Institutes of Health (NIH) recommended that physicians adopt the BMI as an index of obesity. It has now become the standard formula for assessing a person's risk of developing weight-related diseases, such as heart disease, high blood pressure, and diabetes.

    <h3>How does BMI formula work for adults?</h3>
    <p>A standard BMI formula ( or height weight calculator) is used to calculate an adult's BMI. You just need to divide a person's weight by the square of their height to calculate their average BMI.
